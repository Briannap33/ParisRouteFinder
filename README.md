# ParisRouteFinder

Required to create a JavaFX route finder for Paris that generates routes between landmarks. It offers multiple options using depth-first search (DFS), the shortest route via Dijkstra’s algorithm or breadth-first search (BFS), and a cultural route with Dijkstra’s. Users can specify landmarks to avoid or include, and routes are displayed on a vector map with markers.
